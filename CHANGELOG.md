## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`get_dpi_statistics` response example was impossible**: `API.md` documented `total_applications: 15` and `total_categories: 6` beside single-entry arrays, but the tool returns the same lists it counts (there is no pagination on this route), so those totals can never accompany that payload. Corrected to match the example. The `get_client_dpi` example is deliberately unchanged -- it does paginate, returning `paginated_apps` while counting the full list, so its total legitimately exceeds the entries shown.
- **`update_dhcp_reservation` never activated the reservation**: setting a `fixed_ip` wrote the address onto the client entry but omitted `use_fixedip=true`, so the controller stored the IP inertly — the reservation never took effect and never appeared in `list_dhcp_reservations` (which filters on `use_fixedip`). The return value also hard-coded `use_fixedip: true` regardless of the controller response, masking the failure. `update_dhcp_reservation` now sets `use_fixedip=true` whenever a `fixed_ip` is provided, and both `create_dhcp_reservation` and `update_dhcp_reservation` now report the controller's actual `use_fixedip` value — falling back to the requested/known reservation state (coerced via `coerce_bool`) instead of hard-coding `true`.
- **`list_wan_connections` on Integration v1 (issue #100)**: `GET /integration/v1/sites/{site_id}/wans` returns only `id` and `name`, but `WANConnection` required `site_id`, `wan_type`, `interface` and `status`, so every response raised `ValidationError` and the tool was unusable in local API mode. Those four fields are now optional. There is no per-WAN detail route to enrich the sparse record from, so relaxing the model is the only fix.
- **`get_device_details` on Integration v1 (issue #108)**: the tool reads the Integration v1 device route but parsed the response with the legacy `Device` model, which requires `type` and `mac` and types `state` as an integer. The Integration v1 API sends `macAddress`, no `type` at all, and a string `state` (`"ONLINE"`), so every call raised `ValidationError` for every device in local API mode. Now parsed with `IntegrationDevice`, the model that matches the endpoint.
- **`IntegrationDevice.features` / `.interfaces`**: both were typed `list[str]` but the controller returns objects (`features.accessPoint`, `interfaces.ports[...]`, `interfaces.radios[...]`). This also broke `list_integration_devices` and `get_integration_device` against real hardware.
- **`list_dpi_applications` on Integration v1 (issue #108)**: `GET /integration/v1/dpi/applications` returns only `{"id": 3, "name": "ICQ"}`, but `DPIApplication` required `category_id` and typed `id` as a string, so every response raised `ValidationError` and the tool was unusable in local API mode. `category_id` is now optional, `id` accepts the numeric form the Integration v1 route sends, and `category_id`/`category_name` also accept the API's camelCase spellings.
- **`WEB` firewall matching target (issue #106)**: `MatchingTarget` was missing the `WEB` member that the UniFi controller returns for web-category rules, so any policy using it failed model validation. Because `list_firewall_policies` validates the whole payload, a single `WEB` rule made the entire policy list unavailable rather than just that one entry.
- **`get_dpi_statistics` / `list_top_applications` always reported zero applications**: the `stat/dpi` path they queried answers with nothing on current controllers. Counters are now read from the `stat/sitedpi` report (POST with type `by_app`/`by_cat`). The `time_range` parameter is removed — the counters are lifetime totals and no variant of the endpoint accepts a window. Controllers that run traffic identification through the flow engine report an empty result with a note pointing at the flow tools. Documented in `API.md`.
- **Spectrum tools queried a nonexistent site-wide path**: spectrum data is per access point at `stat/spectrum-scan/{ap_mac}`; the site-wide `stat/spectrumscan` path 404'd on every call. `get_spectrum_scan` queries one AP or enumerates the site's APs, returning the controller's per-AP shape; `list_spectrum_interference` flattens each radio's `spectrum_table` annotated with AP MAC and radio. An AP that has never run an RF scan reports empty tables — a state, not an error.
- **`get_speed_test_history` queried a nonexistent resource**: `rest/speedtest` fails every call with `api.err.InvalidObject`; results are stored in the `stat/report/archive.speedtest` report (`xput_download`/`xput_upload` in Mbps, `latency` in ms, `time` in epoch milliseconds). The tool now POSTs the report query with a caller-selectable window (`hours`, default one week) and returns ISO 8601 timestamps.
- **`list_backups` and the backup schedule tools used invented routes**: `list_backups` requested the site-less `/api/backup/list-backups`, which the controller rejects with `api.err.NoSiteContext` on an HTTP 401 — surfaced as "Authentication failed". Backups are listed with `POST cmd/backup {"cmd": "list-backups"}`. `get_backup_schedule`/`configure_backup_schedule` used a `rest/backup/schedule` resource that does not exist (`api.err.InvalidObject`); the schedule is the `auto_backup` settings section. UniFi OS consoles do not carry that section — their scheduled backups are console-level — so reads report `configured: false` with an explanation and writes refuse with the same; self-hosted controllers read and write the section's real fields.
- **Retry hangs (issue #97)**: with the default 30 s request timeout and 3 retries, one logical request can burn ~127 s (4 attempts plus backoff), and a tool that authenticates before its data call stacks two of those — the reported four-minute hangs. Retries now also respect a total wall-clock budget (`UNIFI_RETRY_TOTAL_TIMEOUT`, default 60 s) covering all attempts and backoff waits, failing fast with a message naming the budget and the knob.
- **Hotspot package tools (issue #108, item B3)**: `/integration/v1/sites/{site}/hotspot/packages` 404s and no Integration v1 route for packages exists; the classic `rest/hotspotpackage` surface answers. Duration is hours-granular (sent as `hours`, rounded up from `duration_minutes`), price is `amount` with `currency` alongside. The previous bandwidth/quota/enabled parameters are removed rather than remapped: the controller's validator never acknowledged any of them.
- **Voucher tools (issue #108, items B1 and A3)**: every tool called `/integration/v1/sites/{site}/vouchers`, which no controller serves; the documented surface is `/v1/sites/{siteId}/hotspot/vouchers`. The `Voucher` model now mirrors the documented camelCase response (only `id` required, absent fields omitted), `create_vouchers` sends the documented body (`name`, `timeLimitMinutes`), generation replies nested under a `vouchers` key are unwrapped, `code` accepts the string form live controllers send, and `bulk_delete_vouchers` reads `{"vouchersDeleted": N}` and refuses an empty filter.
- **`get_application_info` (issue #108, item B5)**: requested an `application/info` resource, which no controller serves, so the tool 404'd everywhere. Now calls the documented Integration API info route (prefix varies by API mode: `/v1/info` on Cloud V1, `/proxy/network/integration/v1/info` on local gateways) and reports its `applicationVersion` as `application_version`, passing any additional keys a controller sends through verbatim.
- **`list_pending_devices` (issue #101)**: the Integration v1 API has no `/devices/pending` route — the path matches `/devices/{deviceId}`, so the controller rejects the literal string `pending` with `api.request.argument-type-mismatch`. Unadopted devices are read from the legacy `stat/device` route, flagged `adopted=false`, with client-side pagination.
- **Wired clients reported zero traffic**: the sta route reports wired clients' counters as `wired-tx_bytes`, `wired-rx_bytes`, `wired-tx_packets` and `wired-rx_packets`; every client tool read only the plain keys. The `Client` model now fills the plain fields from the `wired-` keys in a before-validator, and `get_client_statistics` reads both key families. Wireless clients are unaffected: their plain keys are present and win.
- **Per-network and per-WLAN statistics were site-wide totals**: networks were matched to clients by VLAN read from a `vlan_id` key `networkconf` does not have (the field is `vlan`), so every network matched every client via `None == None`; the WLAN matcher's `or not is_wired` clause admitted every wireless client to every WLAN; and `get_subnet_info` always reported `vlan_id: null`. Clients are now matched on `network_id`, WLANs on `essid` alone, and byte sums also read the `wired-tx_bytes`/`wired-rx_bytes` keys wired clients report, so a network of wired servers stops reporting zero traffic.

### Changed

- **`list_wan_connections` output contract**: optional fields now default to `None` instead of `[]`/`False` (`dns_servers`, `is_backup`), and the tool dumps with `exclude_none=True`, so fields the controller does not report are omitted rather than emitted as `null`. An absent key means "not reported", never "empty" or "false" — consumers must look keys up defensively. Documented in `API.md`.
- **`get_device_details` output shape**: now the Integration v1 shape — `mac_address`/`ip_address` rather than `mac`/`ip`, a string `state`, no `type` — and dumped with `exclude_none=True` so unreported keys are omitted rather than emitted as `null`. Documented in `API.md`. The legacy `/ea/` shape is unchanged for `search_devices` and `list_devices_by_type`.
- **`list_dpi_applications` / `list_dpi_categories` output contract**: optional fields now default to `None` instead of `[]`/`True` (`protocols`, `ports`, `enabled`), and both tools dump with `exclude_none=True`, so fields the controller does not report are omitted rather than emitted as `null`. An absent key means "not reported", never "empty" or "disabled". Both tools are now documented in `API.md`.

### Tests

- Corrected `test_update_ip` to assert the PUT body enables `use_fixedip`, and added `test_update_name_only_does_not_enable_fixedip` to ensure metadata-only updates don't flip the flag.
- **Fixture MAC moved to the RFC 7042 documentation range**: `test_firewall_policy.py` used a sample client MAC whose OUI belongs to Proxmox/QEMU — a real VM's address from someone's network rather than a synthetic value. Replaced with `00:00:5e:00:53:01` from the range RFC 7042 reserves for documentation; the value is opaque to every assertion that reads it.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Protect Phase 3 docs update**: documented the new read-only Protect surfaces in `API.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/UNIFI_API.md` so the repo now calls out devices, live views, and events as wired where applicable.
- **Protect device surface**: added `list_protect_devices` as the read-only device update/message tool for the Phase 3 Protect module.
- **Protect views surface**: added `list_protect_views` as the live views / viewer metadata tool for the Phase 3 Protect module.
- **Protect events surface**: added `list_protect_events` as the read-only Protect event / alarm notification tool for the Phase 3 Protect module.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Critical startup bug (issue #42)**: `ImportError: cannot import 'config' from 'agnost'` prevented the server from starting for all users, even when `AGNOST_ENABLED=false`. Root cause: `agnost` v0.1.13 removed the `config` export, and the old code imported it unconditionally at module top-level. Fixed by moving agnost imports inside the conditional block — they now only execute when `AGNOST_ENABLED=true` and `AGNOST_ORG_ID` is set, and any import or runtime failure is gracefully caught and logged as a warning.

### Tests

- Added `tests/unit/test_main_agnost_import.py` with 3 regression tests covering missing `config` export, agnost not installed, and agnost disabled scenarios.
- Test count: 1,159 passing (up from 1,156).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-18

### Added

**RADIUS & Guest Portal — Complete CRUD (4 new tools)**

- `get_radius_account` — Retrieve a single RADIUS account by ID; password field auto-redacted
- `update_radius_account` — Update username, password, VLAN, tunnel type, enabled status, and notes; confirm/dry-run support
- `get_hotspot_package` — Retrieve a single hotspot package by ID
- `update_hotspot_package` — Update name, duration, bandwidth limits, quotas, price, currency, and enabled status; confirm/dry-run support

These complete full CRUD for RADIUS accounts and hotspot packages. Phase 6 (Enhanced RADIUS & Guest Portal) is now feature-complete.

### Fixed

- **QoS Tools**: Fixed runtime `TypeError` in 6 `audit_action` calls in `qos.py` that incorrectly used `action=` keyword argument instead of the required `action_type=`. Affected `create_qos_profile`, `update_qos_profile`, `configure_smart_queue`, `disable_smart_queue`, `create_traffic_route`, `update_traffic_route`. Would have crashed at runtime whenever audit logging was enabled.
- **Site Manager**: Removed duplicate `@require_site_manager` decorator on `get_sdwan_config_status` (was applied twice — redundant and confusing).
- **Topology Tests**: Fixed 6 `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'AsyncMockMixin._execute_mock_call' was never awaited` warnings in the topology test suite. Root cause: 6 tests called `client.settings.get_integration_path()` through an auto-created `AsyncMock` (because `mock_instance.settings` was not set). Fixed by adding `mock_instance.settings = mock_settings` to each affected test.
- **Backup Client**: Added 3 missing methods to `UniFiClient` that `backups.py` calls at runtime:
  - `get_restore_status(operation_id)` — returns `not_supported` stub (endpoint not in UniFi API)
  - `configure_backup_schedule(...)` — `PUT /proxy/network/api/s/{site}/rest/backup/schedule`
  - `get_backup_schedule(site_id)` — `GET /proxy/network/api/s/{site}/rest/backup/schedule`
  Previously these silently fell back to an `AttributeError` handler in `backups.py`.

### Tests

- Added `TestUniFiClientBackupMethods` with 5 tests covering the new backup client methods.
- Test count: 1,156 passing (up from 1,128).
- Zero `RuntimeWarning` coroutine warnings (down from 6).
